    Whether or not the constraints need to be switched around when performing arc consitency.
    I.e. if for a constraint (a, b) an equivalent constraint (b, a) exists, this needs to false.
    If unsure about it's usage, always leave unassigned (default is true).
    This is soley for perfomance reasons, while the algorithm wont work as intended, if this is wrongfully declared false.
